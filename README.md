# Heart Beat Monitoring Task

This code can be used to imitate a BLE device that uses the standard specification "Heart Rate Service" with the use of ESP32 and a client such as a mobile device which is capable of bluetooth connectivity.

Once the client device is connected , the ESP32 starts sends periodic simulated bpm readings (every 10 seconds) to the connected client.
